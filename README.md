CyberForce Competition 2022 - Sole Zon Solis Website, a subsidiary of Vita Vehiculum

## About
This website was created by me for the 2022 National CyberForce competition environment. Written in C# and .NET, it allows green team users to view our solar farm power generation data, company information, and submit a contact form that can upload files to an FTP server and send emails to an SMTP server. This website also contains an admin interface that allows an admin, which is authenticated with Active Directory, to view all files on the FTP server and outgoing emails from the contact page.

Our team placed 17th nationally out of over 170 teams, with one of the highest green team scores throughout the competiton.
